However, many renderers – like Github’s and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.1Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they’re easier and only they support syntax highlighting.1234567891011121314```javascriptvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";alert(s);``` ```pythons = \"Python syntax highlighting\"print s``` ```No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.``` 12var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";alert(s); 12s = \"Python syntax highlighting\"print s 12No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;. TablesTables aren’t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email – a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.1234567891011121314 Colons can be used to align columns.| Tables | Are | Cool || ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 || col 2 is | centered | $12 || zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.

Inline HTMLYou can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it’ll mostly work pretty well.1234567 &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Definition list&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Is something people use sometimes.&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Markdown in HTML&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Does *not* work **very** well.

Horizontal Rule12345678910111213 Three or more...---Hyphens***Asterisks___Underscores Three or more… Hyphens Asterisks Underscores Line BreaksMy basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover – hit once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You’ll soon learn to get what you want. “Markdown Toggle” is your friend.Here are some things to try out: 123456Here's a line for us to start with.This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.This line is also a separate paragraph, but...This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. Here’s a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a separate paragraph. This line is also a separate paragraph, but…This line is only separated by a single newline, so it’s a separate line in the same paragraph. (Technical note: Markdown Here uses GFM line breaks, so there’s no need to use MD’s two-space line breaks.) YouTube VideosThey can’t be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:123 &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:1[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE) TeX Mathematical FormulaeA full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet. Here’s a good reference, and you can try stuff out on CodeCogs. You can also play with formulae in the Markdown Here options page.
